In this project I studied how to create a simplest html docs
, remember diffrent git and cmd functions. I make my recipe site.
 It was so easy but I really proud by it.
 I hope that it is not the end of my studing in the Odit Project,
 because I feel that recieve a lot of knowledge from it even
 I have a bit presentation about html and css. Go on!
